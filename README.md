### 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm a **Tech Architect & Team Lead** leading a powerhouse team of 20, shaping high-performance platforms in the travel tech space. With over a decade in the field, I’ve architected scalable systems, built microservice ecosystems, and delivered rock-solid solutions — from B2B to B2C to white-label SuperApps.

My obsession? Turning chaos into clean code and ideas into living, breathing products.
